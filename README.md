# 🍔 Doodle-Based Food Recognition Model

Ever been so hungry that you just started doodling your cravings?  
This project turns your food scribbles into CNN-based predictions. 🍕✍️🤖

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Draw a food item on the canvas.
- Click "Predict".
- Be amazed (or mildly confused) by the results.

---

## 💻 How to Run the GUI (Locally)

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python doodle_gui.py
```

## 🚀 How to Train the Model (via Google Colab)

Model training requires a GPU for sanity.

- Open `train_model.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Upload your dataset (e.g., food categories from QuickDraw)
- Run the cells
- Save the generated `food_model.h5`
- Place it in the same directory as `doodle_gui.py`

Boom — you’re good to go.
